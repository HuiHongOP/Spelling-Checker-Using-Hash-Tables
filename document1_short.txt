When day comes we ask ourselves,
where can we find light in this never-ending shade?
The loss we carryd,
a sea we must wade.
We've braved the bwlly of the beast,
We've learned that quiet isn't always peace,
and the norms and notions
of what just is
isn't always just-ice.
And yet the dawn is ours
before we knew it.
Somehow we do it.
Somehow we've weathered and witnessed
a nation that isn't broken,
but simply unfinoshed.
We the successiors of a country and a time
where a skiny Black girl
descended from slaves and raised by a single mother
can dreamx of becoming president
only to find herself reciting for one.
And yes we are far from polished.
Far from pristine.
